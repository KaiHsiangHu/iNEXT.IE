Description: Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept spanning different levels of organization from
            genes to ecosystems. 'iNEXT.IE' extends 'iNEXT' by incorporating Inter-specific Encounter (IE), 
            which accounts for speciesâ€™ absolute abundances. 
            This package provides functions to compute standardized diversity estimates 
            with a common sample size or sample coverage. The package features size- and coverage-based 
            rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves to facilitate rigorous comparison 
            across individual assemblages. Asymptotic diversity estimates are also provided.
