Description: Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept covering different levels of organization from
            genes to ecosystems. 'iNEXT.IE' extends 'iNEXT' to incorporate Inter-specific Encounter (IE) 
            of biodiversity. This package provides functions to compute standardized diversity estimates 
            with a common sample size or sample coverage. The package features size- and coverage-based 
            rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves to facilitate rigorous comparison 
            across individual assemblages.
