\title{ggplot2 extension for plotting q-profile}
\usage{
ggMLEAsyIE(output, log2 = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{the output of the function \code{MLEAsyIE}.\cr}

\item{log2}{whether to apply a log2 transformation to diversity or not.\cr}
}
\value{
a q-profile based on the maximum likelihood estimation and the asymptotic diversity estimate.\cr\cr
}
\description{
\code{ggMLEAsyIE} is a \code{ggplot2} extension for an \code{MLEAsyIE} object to plot q-profile (which depicts the maximum likelihood estimation and asymptotic diversity estimate with respect to order q) for q between 0.4 and 2 (in increments of 0.2).\cr\cr 
In the plot, only confidence intervals of the asymptotic diversity will be shown when both the maximum likelihood estimation and asymptotic diversity estimate are computed.
}
\examples{
# Plot diversity for data with order q between 0.4 and 2 (in increments of 0.2 by default).
data("spider")
output_MLEAsy <- MLEAsyIE(spider, rho = 0.3)
ggMLEAsyIE(output_MLEAsy, log2 = TRUE)
