  Spider abundance data
}
\description{
  Spider abundance data (Sackett et al., 2011) were collected from experimental plots in the Harvard Forest, located in Petersham, Massachusetts, USA. The experiment involved two canopy-level manipulations designed to mimic structural changes caused either by logging or infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid. The study aimed to assess the long-term ecological consequences of losing the dominant forest tree, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), due to infestation by the nonnative insect Adelges tsugae (Ellison et al., 2010). Two treatments were applied: (1) the hemlock-girdled treatment, where bark and cambium were removed using knives or chainsaws, and trees were left standing to die gradually over 30 months, mimicking mortality due to adelgid infestation; and
(2) the hemlock-logged treatment, where all hemlocks greater than 20 cm in diameter were harvested and removed, along with any merchantable white pine and hardwoods.
